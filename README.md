# Personal Website - emanueledenaro.it

This is my first website built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. The site is a personal project that has allowed me to learn and put into practice my front-end development skills.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- And a series of other dependencies, which include:

### Dependencies:

- `@formspree/react`: This library allows you to send emails directly from a website using Formspree, a contact form service.
- `@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`, `@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`: These packages are part of FontAwesome, a popular icon library. They allow you to easily use FontAwesome icons in your React project.
- `@headlessui/react`: This is a completely unstyled collection of React components that can be used to build interactive user interfaces. They are "headless" (no default interface) so you can style them however you want.
- `@heroicons/react`: This is an icon library developed by the same creators of Tailwind CSS. It contains a set of icons that integrate well with Tailwind projects.
- `@tailwindcss/forms`: This plugin for Tailwind CSS provides a series of helpful CSS classes for styling forms.
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`: These packages are part of Testing Library, a set of tools very useful for testing the output of React code. `jest-dom` offers custom assertions for Jest, `react` is the React specific testing library, and `user-event` simulates user events for testing.
- `aos`: AOS stands for "Animate On Scroll". It is a small library that allows you to animate elements as you scroll the page.
- `react`: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's the basis of your project.
- `react-dom`: This library is used to manipulate the DOM in the web page with React. It is used in conjunction with React.
- `react-scripts`: This is a set of scripts from the Create React App project that include commands for building, testing, and starting a React application.
- `react-scroll`: This library allows you to create smooth scrolling between your page's components.
- `react-toastify`: It is used to add toast notifications to your website. Toast notifications are those small messages that generally appear at the top or bottom right of the screen.
- `web-vitals`: This package provides utilities for measuring Web Vitals, important metrics for user experience on the web, such as loading time, interactivity, etc.

### DevDependencies:

- `gh-pages`
- `tailwindcss`

## Installation

To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/emanueledenaro.it.git
cd emanueledenaro.it
```

## Installation of Dependencies

After cloning the project, you will need to install the project's dependencies. This is possible thanks to Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

First of all, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download Node.js and npm from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). Installing Node.js should also include npm.

To check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open the terminal and type:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

These commands should show the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

Once confirmed that Node.js and npm are installed, navigate to the

project directory (where the `package.json` file is located) and type the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will read the `package.json` file and automatically install all listed dependencies.

When the installation is complete, you can start the development server with the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Now you should be able to see your website running on your local machine, typically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
